# The Game "Rock Paper Scissors" in Elm

Janken (じゃん拳 janken) is the Japanese equivalent of Rock Paper
Scissors, but taken to a whole new level in terms of usage and
importance in daily life. If there is ever a clash of opinions between
two people in Japan, more often than not this potentially embarassing
situation will be decided with janken.

Hopefully this will be useful to someone trying to learn Elm!
